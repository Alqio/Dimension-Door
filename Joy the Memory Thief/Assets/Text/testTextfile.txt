now joy, i know you're good at what you do, but this one is rare.
it's for a very special client. we don't want to dissapoint him.
it's hard to find a mechanic who actually enjoys their work.
well anyway you know that it's important to know what kind of mind you're going into beforhand.
i'll try to make it short.
basically he's a mechanic, doesn't really have family, which is perfect for us.
well anyway he's pretty much obsessed with gears, don't know why he didn't become a locksmith.
that's going a bit off topic, but yeah he likes gears so much that everyone just calls him gear.
weird right?
the memory you're trying to collect is of when he built his first machine.
collectors really want strange memories don't they. the thing didn't even do anything.
well i guess that's none of my business.
ok enough chit chat. i expect good results from you.

we went through a lot of trouble to get her here. celebrities are such a pain.
their bodyguards and surveillance systems are so hard to get rid of.
she's so popular that she's been modified in all kinds of ways to slow her aging.
if she could keep up her popularity she would probably live for 100 years looking exactly the way she looks now.
that's kind of creepy if you ask me.
sad that it's all going to end here, but a job's a job.
don't know if a few billion is worth all this effort...
oh well not like we've ever had any standards.
just get the memory of her singing at her mothers grave.
i'm counting on you.
